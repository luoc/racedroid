Racedroid is a project I try to develop to detect the race condition vulnerability in android platform.
It contains three parts at present:
1. Netdroid
detect race condition in net flow
2. Procdroid
detect race condition in android process
3. filedroid
detect race condition in file system of android
The first part I try to develop is the Netdroid. My first aim is to sniffer all the net flow using man-in-the-middle attack. 2012-6-28
